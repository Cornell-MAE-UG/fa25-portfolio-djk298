## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Deepti Kousik, and I am pursuing a degree in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Cornell University (Class of 2027) to pursue my passions for aerospace innovation and hands-on problem solving. As Propulsion Lead for Cornell Rocketry, I design and oversee systems from concept to assembly, with a focus on ownership over hardware and working with pressurized fluid systems. I'm driven by the challenge of building reliable high-performance components that push the boundaries of student rocketry. Beyond this, I serve on the Outreach Committee for the Society of Women Engineers and as a Cornell Engineering Ambassador, where I strive to inspire future engineers and foster positive environments in STEM.
