As part of MAE 3230 - Introduction to Fluid Mechanics, I dissected a chainsaw and analyzed its inner components with the rest of my group. Click the image below to watch our video, or click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xjMJ2SVILU)! For this project, I took a part a chainsaw manually, revealing the inner components such as the carburetor, flywheel, piston, and more. Using a hands-on form of analysis, we worked through the chainsaw slowly to figure out the purpose of each component and their relationships. I took measurements of several key areas in order to then calculate key fluid mechanical characteristics, such as the Reynolds Number. For our presentation, I helped setup, calculate, and verify these values. I developed an in-depth understanding of carburetors, 2 stroke engines, Bernoulli's Equation, and chainsaws!
