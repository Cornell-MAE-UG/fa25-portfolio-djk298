Currently, my project for the 2025-2026 school year for Cornell Rocketry revolves around designing the system architecture for the fluid systems of our first ever bipropellant liquid rocket engine. This involves trade studies to determine the fuel and oxidizer used, determining the valves and sensors needed, sourcing components, calculating lengths of fluid lines, creating testing and safety procedures, and assembling the final fluid systems. This is the high-level piping and instrumentation diagram for the fluid systems:
