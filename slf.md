# Your Project Title

**Team:** _Team Dragonfly_
**Client(s):** Cornell CALS Extension / E\&J Gallo Winery / National Grape  

## Problem statement (most important)

Vineyard owners and grape farmers in the Northeast United States are invaded by high numbers of spotted lanternflies that drive out beneficial native species and infiltrate harvests (src). The spotted lanternfly (SLF) population grows rapidly due to a high number of nymphs surviving to adulthood, where they reproduce abundantly, increasing their population by a factor of 5.47 (src). Current solutions primarily target adults rather than their egg masses, but rapid population growth is already occurring by this stage, increasing the severity of their impact in a certain location regardless. 

## Impact

By targeting the SLFs’ success in reproduction through egg masses, we can reduce the overall population of SLFs in a vineyard or area by reducing their reproduction factor from 5.47, significantly reducing their impact on crop yield over time and reducing the number of SLFs per vine from 400 (src).

## Proposed direction(s)

### Concept A (primary): <1-line name>

**What it is:** <1–2 sentences.>  
**How it would be used:** <2–4 bullet “user flow” steps.>  
**Why it’s better than the status quo:** <2–3 bullets.>  
**End-of-semester proof-of-concept:** <what you can realistically build/test in MAE 2250.>  

SLF Scraper
The Scraper would be a device that makes it quicker and simpler for SLF egg masses to be removed. The scraper would allow for accessibility of egg masses in hard-to-reach places (ie, under truck beds and high on buildings). 
Process: 
User spots egg masses visually or using the light feature 
User extends the scraper using telescoping feature
User removes the egg masses off the surface
Egg masses are automatically dispensed into the scraper housing for easy disposal
Comparison to Industry: 
Current SLF scrapers are credit card-sized & require the user to come into close contact with the egg masses
Our scraper makes the process simpler & improves accessibility to hard-to-reach spots 

For our minimum viable product, we can design and manufacture a fully working prototype that extends and contains egg masses after scraping, as well as a preliminary UI for technological features. In the long term, we will create a working UI, potential camera system, and target the reproducibility of this product to make it openly available in the market.


### Concepts B: Nymph Netting
This product would involve setting new traps around the base of trees to catch nymphs that are unable to fly and attempting to climb trees to feed. The netting would be woven around the base of trees in a spiral formation to eventually funnel and trap the young SLFs, preventing their ability to reproduce. For our minimum viable product, we aim to create funneled netting that can be set up around a tree trunk that attracts spotted lanternflies through scent. Long term, we aim to create a product with further testing that attracts, traps, and kills nymphs and has the flexibility to be set up around different structures and types of trees. 


## Key risks / unknowns

- A risk is that a trap may unintentionally impact other beneficial insects or wildlife. If a trap also harms beneficial insects, then the negative ecological effect this has may outway the benefits of trapping the lantern flies. We can reduce this risk by testing smaller scale traps with different entry funnels and setups, and seeing how many lantern flies versus beneficial insects become trapped.
- A risk is that not enough users may implement the solution consistently. Even if the scraper is effective, if users do not use it enough then it may not have a big enough impact to impact the lantern fly population. We can reduce this risk by giving classmates and others a survey, asking questions such as how convenient the scraper is, how easy the setup is, and how likely they are to use it, and improve based on advice given. 

## Questions for the client
Focus on questions they can answer from lived experience.
1. **Are there any specific sounds or scents that SLFs are attracted to?**  
   *Decision affected:* Knowing this will allow us to choose more effective lures and trap more SLFs.
2. **Do you have any gripes with the current credit card scraper situation and do you think that we can make this process a more enjoyable and comfortable situation?**  
   *Decision affected:* In the case that they lay the eggs on specific materials or in specific microclimates, we can apply that to our egg scraper matching specific shapes or being more effective on specific textures / sensing features of microclimates to notify the user of potential egg laying spots to look out for 
3. **Does the client already have traps in place, how are they luring the lanternflys, how effective are the traps, and are there any features of the traps that are not good (for example not enough capacity)** 
   *Decision affected:* We can learn from these experiences to try and modify our traps so that we can use the ideas that work and avoid the things that don’t.
4. **Do you find the current scraper to be functional, as in are there ever eggs too high to reach, too hard to scrape off due to geometry of the object or the consistency of the eggs? **  
   *Decision affected:* Knowing this will allow us to design the geometry of the scraper in a way that can account for as many situations as possible. It can also help us know if it's worth it to integrate some sort of extendable arm so that the user can reach higher up.
