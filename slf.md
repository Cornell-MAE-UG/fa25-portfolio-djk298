# Attacking Spotted Lanternflies at the Root: Impacting Reproduction Rate

**Team:** _Team Dragonfly_
**Client(s):** Cornell CALS Extension / E\&J Gallo Winery / National Grape  

## Problem statement (most important)

Vineyard owners and grape farmers in the Northeast United States are invaded by high numbers of spotted lanternflies that drive out beneficial native species and infiltrate harvests. The spotted lanternfly (SLF) population grows rapidly due to a high number of nymphs surviving to adulthood, where they reproduce abundantly, increasing their population by a factor of 5.47. Current solutions primarily target adults rather than their egg masses, but rapid population growth is already occurring by this stage, increasing the severity of their impact in a certain location regardless. 

## Impact

By targeting the SLFs’ success in reproduction through egg masses, we can reduce the overall population of SLFs in a vineyard or area by reducing their reproduction factor from 5.47. This will slow down their population increase and potentially stagnate it in an area, reducing the number of SLFs per vine from 400.

## Proposed direction(s)

### Concept A (primary): SLF Scraper

**What it is:** The Scraper would be a device that makes it quicker and simpler for SLF egg masses to be removed. The scraper would allow for accessibility of egg masses in hard-to-reach places (ie, under truck beds and high on buildings). 

**How it would be used:** 
- User spots egg masses visually or using the light feature 
- User extends the scraper using telescoping feature
- User removes the egg masses off the surface
- Egg masses are automatically dispensed into the scraper housing for easy disposal
**Why it’s better than the status quo:** 
- Current SLF scrapers are credit card-sized & require the user to come into close contact with the egg masses
- Our scraper makes the process simpler & improves accessibility to hard-to-reach spots 
**End-of-semester proof-of-concept:** 
For our minimum viable product, we can design and manufacture a fully working prototype that extends and contains egg masses after scraping, as well as a preliminary UI for technological features. In the long term, we will create a working UI, potential camera system, and target the reproducibility of this product to make it openly available in the market.


### Concepts B: Nymph Netting
**What it is:** 
This product would involve setting new traps around the base of trees to attract and catch nymphs that are unable to fly and attempting to climb trees to feed. The netting would be woven around the base of trees in a spiral formation to eventually funnel and trap the young SLFs, allowing for disposal before reaching adulthood. 

**How it would be used:** 
- User weaves netting around base of trees in a vineyard/desired location 
- User provides source of electricity for high frequency vibrations
 -User waits and disposes of nymphs collected after enough time has passed
**Why it’s better than the status quo:** 
- Current traps don’t target nymphs specifically and therefore do not impact - reproduction 
- This product uses recent research to attract nymphs by vibrating at a high frequency
- This will trap nymphs in higher numbers than current products typically can
**End-of-semester proof-of-concept:** 
For our minimum viable product, we aim to create funneled netting that can be set up around a tree trunk that attracts spotted lanternflies through vibrations. Long term, we aim to create a product with further testing that attracts, traps, and kills nymphs and has the flexibility to be set up around different structures and types of trees. 

## Key risks / unknowns

- A trap may unintentionally impact other beneficial insects or wildlife. If a trap harms beneficial insects, then the negative ecological effect this has may outway the benefits of trapping the SLFs. We can reduce this by testing smaller scale traps with different entry funnels and setups and analyzing the resulting insects that are trapped.
- It may be difficult to implement these solutions consistently. Even if the scraper is effective, without users willing to use it, it will not impact the lantern fly population. We can reduce this risk by creating a survey: asking questions such as how convenient the scraper is, how easy the setup is, how likely they are to use it, and improve our design based on advice given. 

## Questions for the client

1. **Are there any specific sounds or scents that SLFs are attracted to?**  
   *Decision affected:* Knowing this will allow us to choose more effective lures and trap more SLFs.
2. **What are your biggest gripes with current scrapers used to remove egg masses?**  
   *Decision affected:* This will inform our design process, as we ultimately want to improve comfort and efficiency with the scrapers. We can modify our scraper to match specific shapes or be more effective on certain textures/microclimates if these are issues. 
3. **What traps do you currently use - how do they catch/dispose of the SLFs, and are they effective?** 
   *Decision affected:* We can learn from these experiences to try and modify our traps (specifically the netting) to avoid ideas that do not work in practice. 
4. **What are the main barriers to removing egg masses: are they too high to reach, too hard to scrape off due to geometry of the object, or the consistency of the eggs? **  
   *Decision affected:* Knowing this will allow us to design the geometry of the scraper in a way that can account for as many situations as possible. It can also help us know if it's worth it to integrate some sort of extendable arm so that the user can reach higher up.
